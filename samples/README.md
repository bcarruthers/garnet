# Samples

## Flocking

[[Code](https://github.com/bcarruthers/garnet/blob/master/samples/Garnet.Samples.Flocking)]

This sample demonstrates classic boids-style flocking or steering, with behaviors tuned so agents form clusters. Neighbor forces are calculated in brute-force fashion without use of spatial structures.
