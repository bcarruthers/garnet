# Samples

## Engine

[[Code](Garnet.Samples.Engine)]

This is a wrapper over Veldrid and OpenTK.OpenAL used by the samples. It makes sprite and tile drawing easier and includes texture atlas creation.

## Flocking

[[Code](Garnet.Samples.Flocking)]

This sample shows boids-style flocking and clustering using Garnet ECS and Veldrid.

## Roguelike

[[Code](Garnet.Samples.Roguelike)]

This sample shows tiling code useful for classic roguelikes using Veldrid. The core logic and types are idiomatic F# and there is no use of Garnet ECS.
